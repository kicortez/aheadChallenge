Run:
- No special setup needed. Clone and run the project

Notes:
- I'm fairly new to SwiftUI, so I wanted to work with that
- No networking provided. The relevant controller should be good enough for a quick update for network needs
- I used controllers/view models to manage states and actions

Challenges/improvements:
- Drag and drop UI for recap. I had some initial idea for setting up the droppable area but no time to continue
- Wasn't able to implement and polish transitions and animations. The confetti for correct recap is also missing
- I added the test for decoding the model, but wasn't able to do so for controllers/models

I had fun :)
